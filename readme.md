# screen-starter-project

It's a starter project using some of the modules we use for forms and for details pages. It uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) which you might already know.

The hope is that it gives a smooth launchpad for your projects. Please fork this and follow along. ðŸ‘‡

## Development

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
npm run build
npm run start

# generate static project
npm run generate
```

By default it will run the dev server on http://127.0.0.1:10101
